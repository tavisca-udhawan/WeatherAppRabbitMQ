		/// However it is possible to include IP options which can increase the size of the

		/// intermediate nodes to encapsulate datagrams inside of another protocol such as
		/// IPsec (used for VPNs and the like) in order to route the packet to its destination.
		/// So if you do not know the MTU on your particular network path, it is best to leave
		/// a reasonable margin for other header information that you may not have anticipated.
